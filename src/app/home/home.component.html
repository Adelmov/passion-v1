          Carlos Santana is a guitar legend. Delivered with a level of passion and soul equal to the legendary sonic charge of his guitar, the sound of Carlos Santana is one of the world’s best-known musicians. For more than four decades-from Santana’s earliest days as a groundbreaking Afro-Latin-blues-rock fusion outfit in San Francisco-Carlos has been the visionary 
          force behind artistry that transcends musical genres and generational, cultural and geographical boundaries. Ever since I was exposed to Santana and his perspective on music, my passion for guitar only grew stronger. I loved
          grabbing my stratocaster and play songs like Smooth.

          Check out my cover of Smooth by Santana where I solo over a backing track and let my fingers do the magic.

      <h5 class="blog-post-meta text-muted">Why it's so important to us</h5>
      <p id="gaming" class="text-muted">
        If you know me and Adelmo, you know that gaming is very important to us. Adelmo plays games both on a console and on pc, which just means he's
        cracked. I know we have overcome obstacles because of games like Minecraft and Clash Rpyale. This platform is place where we can relax and have 
        fun with eachother and our friends.  Gaming solves the problems for us like not being 
        able to interact with our friends and socialize. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted"> 
          Some of our favorite games are Clash Royale, Fortnite, Minecraft, and Call of Duty on Playstation. When we play them it's like we enter a new world. 
          We wil continue our love for games because
          it makes us who we are and influences our lives on a greater scale. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Research to date suggests that playing video games can change the brain regions responsible for attention and visuospatial skills and make them more efficient.

<h1 class="font-weight-bold">Grooves</h1>
<p>
  In music, groove is the sense of an effect of changing pattern in a propulsive rhythm or sense of "swing". In jazz, it can be felt as a quality of persistently 
  repeated rhythmic units, created by the interaction of the music played by a band's rhythm section. Me personally I love adding some groove to
  my jams every now and then.

<h1 class="font-weight-bold">WAH PEDAL!</h1>
<p>Few effects in the guitarists’ arsenal are so instantly recognizable. Even your non-musician friends know what it is.
  Famous guitarists like Jimi Hendrix have used this effect when playing heavy and distorted rock. I love using this effect
  because it adds a unique style when I pump the gain on my amp when I stretched-link
